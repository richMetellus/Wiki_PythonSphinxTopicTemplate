rST Cheatsheet: A Beginner Guide to reStructuredtext
#####################################################


Document Structure
******************

Unlike Markdown, within a restructuredtext document normally there are no heading levels 
assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession 
of headings. 

Markdown document usually have a strict heading::
    
    # header 1 
    ## header 2 
    ### header 3
    #### header 4
    #### header 5 
    ###### header 6

Although any rST document parser will accept some heading like this 
::

    ==================
    Header 1 Section
    ==================

    Header 2 subsection 
    ====================

    Header 3 
    -----------

However, with restructured text, the convention is to use the Python's Style 
Guide for documenting

``#`` with overline, for parts

``*`` with overline, for chapters

``=``, for sections

``-``, for subsections

``^``, for sub-subsections

``"``, for paragraphs

For my preference, I use the following convention

1. For header 1 and 2 you can use underline and overline for the tile, but I prefer 
   to use underline only.
#. I use the following characters for the heading levels

    * ``#`` for H1
    * ``*`` for H2
    * ``=`` for H3
    * ``-`` for H4
    * ``^`` for H5
    * ``"`` for H6


My document structure is usually as followed::

    Header Level 1 for Title 
    ########################

    Sample H2 for subtitle
    ***********************

    The underline must be at least as long as the (sub-) title text.

    Another H2
    **********

    Sample H3
    =========

    Sample H4
    ---------

    Sample H5
    ^^^^^^^^^

    Sample H6
    """""""""

Basic Syntax
*************

Text Formatting 
================

In rST, you can use single asterisk for *italic*,  double 
asterisk for **bold**, and double backtics for ``inline code``

- **Bold text**: ``**Bold text**``
- *Italic*: ``*italic*``
- ``Monospace``: ````Monospace````
- Inline literal ``code``: ````code````

Unicode 
---------

**Unicode** 

Unicode characters are also supported, and interpreted as UTF-8. You can simply 
paste it in the document as needed. Examples:

* α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ, ν, ξ, ο, π, ρ, σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω.
* PlayStation®
* SONY™

or you can also use the ``.. unicode::`` directive to include unicode characters.
(More on directives later).

+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

Block Literals 
===============

You can use double colon ``::`` to create a block literal. The parser will not 
interpret the block literal text as markup.

keep the text aligned.

Inserting Comments 
===================

You can add a comment in the document using the markup ``..`` syntax 
followed by the comment text. Comments are ignored by the parser.

Directives and Roles
*********************

**Directives** and **roles** are syntactic constructions that can add new features 
to the reStructuredText language by interpreting a chuck of text as a specific 
type of markup according to the name of the directive or role.

Roles 

* is a type of inline markup that can be applied to text in the document.
* Syntax: ``:role-name:`interpreted text```

    * the *role name* is a user-defined name and is in between the colons ``:``
    * the *interpreted text* is the text that will be rendered according to the role 
      and is enclosed in backticks `````.


🎯Bonus: Tips for Writing reST Documents
*****************************************

✅ **Use consistent heading styles** throughout the document. 

✅ **Indent lists and blocks properly**— whitespace is important in reST!

✅ **Use cross-references** (``.. _label:``) to link between sections easily. 

✅ **Use python Sphinx project + extensions** for advanced features like LaTeX math, diagrams, 
or API documentation to generate beautiful documentation and output formats.
