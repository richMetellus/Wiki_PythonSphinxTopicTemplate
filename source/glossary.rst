    SerDes
        Serializer/deserializer, is an integrated circuit (IC or chip) transceiver 
        that converts parallel data to serial data and vice versa 

    SFP 
        Small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceivers are a core technology in 
        many networks, providing communication between switches and important 
        network components. SFPâ€™s are popular due to their small size, versatile 
        connection options (copper or fiber optic), and hot swappable capability.

    SGMII
        Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interfaces.
        SGMII supports a single 10M/100M/1G network port over 1,25Gbps SERDES 
        between MAC and PHY, while QSGMII supports four 10M/100M/1G network 
        ports over 5Gbps SERDES between MAC and PHY.
        
    QSGMII
        The quad serial gigabit media-independent interface (QSGMII) is a 
        method of combining four SGMII lines into a 5 Gbit/s interface. 
        QSGMII, like SGMII, uses low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) 
        for the TX and RX data, and a single LVDS clock signal.
